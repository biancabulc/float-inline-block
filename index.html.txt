Happiness, true happiness, is an inner quality. It is a state of mind. If your mind is at peace, you are happy.<br> If your mind is at peace, but you have nothing else, you can be happy. <br>If you have everything the world can give - pleasure, possessions, power - but lack peace of mind, you can never be happy.

On a sunny, hot, windy day<br>
chirping birds come my way<br>
Comfortable, beautiful, smashing<br>
When water comes down and crashing<br>
